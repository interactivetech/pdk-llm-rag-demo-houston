HP Helion Rack is designed to help enterprise IT departments speed their cloud deployments, avoiding months designing, developing and deploying a private cloud, by integrating cloud management software and industry leading infrastructure with best practices.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>As enterprise IT departments accelerate to become internal service providers, they face growing pressure to rapidly deliver flexible computing resources that meet their organization's demanding needs.
