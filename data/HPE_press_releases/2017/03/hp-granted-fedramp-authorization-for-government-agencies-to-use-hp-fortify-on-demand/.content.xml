Static code scanning such as Java, .NET, and other major programming languages for security defects is performed in the system at the code layer followed by an audit review by an HP static auditor.Dynamic web site and web services testing combines &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/webinspect-dynamic-analysis-dast/index.html?&quot;>HP WebInspect&lt;/a> software with manual penetration testing, followed by a review from an HP dynamic tester.
