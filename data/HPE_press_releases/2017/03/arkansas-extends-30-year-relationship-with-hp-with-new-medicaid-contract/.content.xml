Healthcare providers will be able to receive real-time claims adjudication and resolution via a secure provider website, and Medicaid clients will be able to access their information to make healthcare decisions via a secure client website. The state will also take advantage of HP Business Process Services during and after the implementation, which will be used for provider enrollment, claims processing, reporting and audits.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;We have supported the state of Arkansas since 1985 and our employees have developed a comprehensive knowledge of the state's systems, laws and processes, making this new contract a natural fit to enable Arkansas to continue meeting its healthcare goals,&amp;quot; said Susan Arthur, vice president, U.S. Health and Life Sciences Industry, HP Enterprise Services. &amp;quot;With our robust MMIS solution, we are confident that Arkansas will see a great improvement in efficiency and will be able to rely on this system for many years to come.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Arkansas is the 17th state to adopt HP's interChange Healthcare platform, a powerful, proven and constantly evolving solution that gives states and providers access to leading-edge technology. By cutting costs and increasing access to information, the HP interChange platform reduces implementation risk for states and improves provider satisfaction. HP interChange has earned federal certification in 13 states; four other interChange systems are under construction in other states.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP is the nation's largest provider of Medicaid and Medicare process management services, administering $140 billion in benefits a year. It serves as the fiscal agent or principal IT provider for Medicaid in 19 states. HP's U.S. healthcare experience spans payer, government and life science communities.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>About HP&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society.
