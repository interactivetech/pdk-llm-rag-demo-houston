Combining these two entities, the new H3C will be a technology powerhouse in China with a market-leading portfolio that will be #1 in networking and a leader in servers, storage and technology services.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP sees continued long-term growth opportunities in China, and HP China will maintain 100% ownership of its existing China-based Enterprise Services, Software, HP Helion Cloud, Aruba Networks, Printing and Personal Systems businesses.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;HP is making a bold move to win in today's China,&amp;quot; said Meg Whitman, Chairman and CEO, HP. &amp;quot;Partnering with Tsinghua, one of China's most respected institutions, the new H3C will be able to drive even greater innovation for China, in China.The combined company will build upon an extensive and valuable patent portfolio, best-in-class products and customer focus, and Tsinghua's world-class research capability.In one move, we have repositioned HP and H3C to accelerate overall performance and better serve our customers and partners.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>With approximately 8,000 employees and approximately $3.1 billion in annual revenue, the new H3C will be the leading provider of converged infrastructure solutions and technology services in the China market.The company will offer customers a complete portfolio of enterprise IT solutions, including networking, servers, storage and services, and will maintain H3C's current localized, high-touch, customer-first service model.The new H3C will build off of its legacy of innovation, with over 5,700 patents and 2,500 engineers focused on developing differentiated technology solutions for the future of compute infrastructure.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Once the transaction closes, the new H3C will be the exclusive provider for HP's server, storage and networking portfolio, as well as HP's exclusive hardware support services provider in China, customized for that market.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The new H3C will become a subsidiary of Unisplendour, a publicly traded operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co., Ltd., the asset management arm of prestigious Tsinghua University in China. Unisplendour is currently among the top software vendors and system integrators in China, and has been in a long-term strategic distribution partnership with HP since 1999.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Until the close, Henry Tso will continue to lead H3C Technologies' networking business and Ye Jian will continue to lead HP China's Server, Storage and Technology Services businesses.Separately, Robert Mao will remain the chairman of HP China, which will include HP's Enterprise Services, Software and Cloud businesses in China.All three leaders will be actively involved in determining the most effective management team for the new organization.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Weiguo Zhao, Chairman of Tsinghua Unigroup and Unisplendour Corporation, commented: &amp;quot;H3C is a leading networking provider in China and HP China is a leading provider of servers, storage and technology services.Tsinghua andUnisplendour, as the majority shareholder of the new H3C, will embrace and welcome the new H3C to the family of the China domestic IT industry.The transaction for H3C will also release great potential in the China market.Tsinghua has enjoyed a long-term partnership with China HP and H3C.We see extensive synergies with the new H3C.Tsinghua University's leading R&amp;amp;D capability, wide domestic resources, and vast human capital resources will empower the new H3C's growth in the short-term, mid-term, and long-term.We are pleased to announce and look forward to a strong partnership with HP in the many years to come.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The new H3C generated CY2014 adjusted revenues of $3.1 billion, adjusted operating profit of $0.4 billion and adjusted GAAP net income of $0.3 billion. HP will equity account for its investment going forward.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The transaction is expected to close near the end of 2015, subject to Unisplendour shareholder vote, regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>About HP&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society.
