In particular, HP Inc. has:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>A focus on growing profitable share;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Recurring profit streams and strong cash flows;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Meticulous focus on cost and operating efficiencies;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Prudent capital allocation and commitment to shareholder returns;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>And, commitment to investing for the future.&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;Executing on our strategy will produce reliable returns and cash flows while also having the opportunity for long-term growth,&amp;quot; Weisler continued. &amp;quot;The separation enables us to focus our company assets and financial resources on our core businesses, growth opportunities and future while also being very disciplined about delivering long-term, shareholder value.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Weisler then went on to acknowledge the challenging market environment and currency headwinds, but emphasized that HP Inc. business fundamentals are strong, and the team has a proven track record of execution. He outlined pockets of growth and new markets that HP Inc. will pursue to drive growth, including graphics, the A3 copier market, commercial mobility, and 3D printing.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Fiscal 2016 outlook&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Cathie Lesjak, who will become the Chief Financial Officer of HP Inc., provided the financial outlook for the new company in fiscal 2016. Lesjak acknowledged that markets are likely to remain tough for the next several quarters with continued competitive pricing in printing and soft demand in PCs. To offset these challenges, HP Inc.'s strategy will be to protect the core while focusing on accelerating in key areas, including: business printing, graphics, commercial mobility, and services.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>For fiscal 2016, the new company estimates non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.77 and estimates GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.65. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted EPS estimates exclude after-tax costs primarily related to restructuring and separation.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Based on the current environment, HP Inc. anticipates generating cash flow from operations of approximately $3.0 to $3.3 billion in fiscal 2016. With about $0.5 billion in net capital expenditures, free cash flow outlook is in the range of $2.5 to $2.8 billion for fiscal 2016.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP Inc. expects to return 50%-75% of annual free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of a robust dividend and regular share buy backs. In fiscal 2016, the company indicated that it expects to be at the higher end of that range, with approximately $865 million returned through dividends, and the balance returned to shareholders through share repurchases.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP Inc. will trade under the ticker symbol HPQ on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Business segment strategies&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Over the course of the day, the future HP Inc. management team laid out the strategy for the company's individual business segments, including:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Printing Business&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Enrique Lores, who will become President of the Printing Business, provided details on the strategy that will ensure HP maintains its role as the world's leader in printing. Acknowledging market and competitive headwinds, Lores emphasized that printing remains a massive market, currently $234 billion and growing. Echoing Weisler's earlier comments, Lores is optimistic that as a separate company, the Printing Business in particular will successfully drive all-important supplies revenue.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Lores emphasized that the objective of the printing strategy is to drive value for customers by engineering the best printing experience. Lores highlighted several initiatives, including:&lt;/span>&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Ink in the Office -- one of the fastest growing web based services;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Expansion into the A3 copier market where HP Inc. has an opportunity to significantly grow its market share;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Graphics, which has been a leading growth business for HP overall; and&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Managed Print Services, where the shift in customer behavior from transactional to contractual presents HP with an opportunity to increase penetration in supplies.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Stephen Nigro, who will lead the 3D Printing Business, outlined the opportunity the company sees in 3D printing with its MultiJet Fusion technology.The company plans to launch its first product in the market during 2016 focused on addressing customer challenges around speed, quality and cost.Nigro outlined how the company plans to leverage its existing PageWide technology to disrupt the traditional manufacturing market.&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Personal Systems&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Ron Coughlin, who will be President of the Personal Systems Business, gave an overview of how Personal Systems plans to deliver profitable growth moving forward. Leveraging HP's leading market position, powerful pipeline of innovation and ability to execute regardless of the market environment, the new HP Inc. will focus on the commercial PC market and attractive segments of consumer.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The addressable market for Personal Systems is approximately $340 billion, and while Coughlin acknowledged near-term market headwinds are expected to last several quarters, heidentified several opportunities that will propel the Personal Systems Business, including:&lt;/span>&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Clear and systematic market segmentation to identify areas where HP Inc. is under-penetrated;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>A cost focus coupled with great design and innovation to address the Commercial market;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>New form factors, such as convertibles, that complement our existing line-up;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Expanding into Commercial Mobility solutions and services such as &amp;quot;PC-as-a-Service&amp;quot;;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>And exciting new category creation such as Immersive Computing, where the company's new Sprout product has already generated significant interest.&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Webcast details &lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>A webcast of today's event, along with management presentations and other materials, is available at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=1217614&amp;amp;id=7084165&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hp.com%2finvestor%2fSAM2015&quot;>www.hp.com/investor/SAM2015&lt;/a>. This press release contains only a summary of some of the information being presented at today's event and should be read in conjunction with the management presentations and other materials made available on that website.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>About HP&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society. With the broadest technology portfolio spanning printing, personal systems, software, services and IT infrastructure, HP delivers solutions for customers' most complex challenges in every region of the world. More information about HP is available at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=1217614&amp;amp;id=7084168&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hp.com%2f&quot;>http://www.hp.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Use of non-GAAP financial information&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP has included non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. Definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the slides presented at the 2015 Securities Analyst Meeting, which will be available for a period of one year thereafter at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=1217614&amp;amp;id=7084171&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hp.com%2finvestor%2fSAM2015&quot;>www.hp.com/investor/SAM2015&lt;/a>.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP's management uses net revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating income and earnings, net debt, net cash, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and HP's non-GAAP tax rate to evaluate and forecast HP's performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by HP's management to be outside of HP's core business segment operating results. HP also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Free cash flow, as defined below, is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for investment in HP's businesses, funding strategic acquisitions, repurchasing stock and other purposes.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>These non-GAAP financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of HP's results as reported under GAAP. Items such as separation costs and restructuring charges that are excluded from non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and HP's non-GAAP tax rate can have a material impact on cash flows and net earnings per share. In addition, items such as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting HP's cash position, represent the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is not included in non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and HP's non-GAAP tax rate and therefore does not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of those intangible assets. Free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. The non-GAAP financial information that we provide also may differ from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>We compensate for the limitations on our use of these non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. We also provide robust and detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and we encourage investors to review carefully those reconciliations.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>We believe that providing these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by HP's management in its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see HP's results &amp;quot;through the eyes&amp;quot; of management. We further believe that providing this information better enables investors to understand HP's operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures is defined as investments in property, plant and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. HP's management uses free cash flow for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in HP's businesses, funding acquisitions, repurchasing stock and other purposes. HP's management also uses free cash flow to evaluate HP's historical and prospective liquidity. Because net capital expenditures includes proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, HP believes that net capital expenditures provides a more accurate and complete assessment of HP's liquidity. Because free cash flow includes the effect of net capital expenditures that are not reflected in GAAP cash flow from operations, HP believes that free cash flow provides a more accurate and complete assessment of HP's liquidity and capital resources. Total company net debt consists of total debt (including the effects of hedging) less gross cash, which includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and certain liquid long-term investments. Total company net cash consists of gross cash less total debt. Gross cash is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and certain long-term investments that may be liquidated within 90 days pursuant to the terms of existing put options or similar rights. Total company net debt and total company net cash provide useful information to HP's management about the state of HP's consolidated condensed balance sheets.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Forward looking statements&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
