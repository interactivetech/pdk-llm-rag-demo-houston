Using Azure Stack powered by HPE integrated systems, enterprises and service providers will be able to realize the speed and simplicity of the public cloud, combined with the cost-effectiveness and security of an on-premises private cloud. Co-engineered by HPE and Microsoft, the HPE | Azure Stack solution will provide enterprises with an Azure hybrid cloud platform in their own datacenter that is compatible with Azure public cloud services.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;Many enterprises would like to host Azure within their data centers for performance, security or compliance reasons and many service providers would like to offer Azure-compatible services for data sovereignty or other targeted services,&amp;quot; said Paul Miller, vice president of marketing, Converged Data Center Infrastructure, at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. &amp;quot;HPE is teaming with Microsoft to deliver the right mix of on- and off-premises Azure services with built-in security, operations management, pay-as-you-go pricing and the expertise that provides unmatched flexibility and cost savings for enterprise workloads.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The HPE | Azure Stack solution will be built on the world's best-selling server, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=1278633&amp;amp;id=9687706&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww8.hp.com%2fus%2fen%2fproducts%2fproliant-servers%2fproduct-detail.html%3foid%3d7271241&quot;>HPE ProLiant DL380&lt;/a>, as a complete compute, storage, networking and software system.
