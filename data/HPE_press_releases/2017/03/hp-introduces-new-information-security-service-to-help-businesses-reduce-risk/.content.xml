When threats or incidents impact stakeholder objectives, users can quickly identify the source of the risk and make timely decisions to address the threat.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Most organizations today are not able to proactively address security risks before impacting their business. This is due to the lack of necessary visibility into key security data and alerts that can help organizations determine the level of potential risk to their business.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>In spite of this, a recent survey conducted by the Ponemon Institute found that 75 percent of respondents indicated that metrics are &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;very important&amp;quot; to a risk-based security program.&lt;sup>(1)&lt;/sup>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;Security risks are getting harder for organizations to navigate, and point-solution defenses are no match for the adversaries,&amp;quot; said Arthur Wong, senior vice president and general manager, Enterprise Security Services, HP. &amp;quot;By aligning information-security data with stakeholder business objectives, HP Security Metrics Services help transform organizations to a consistent, measurable and proactive security posture to make informed risk decisions and justify security spending.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The new HP Security Metrics Services allows businesses to:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>1) Identify security risk indicators through cutting edge framework&lt;br>&#xa;By utilizing a simple, clear framework that links IT assets to 34 identified key risk components, organizations can prioritize their business objectives and processes and correlate them to threats, vulnerabilities and incidents. These components are underpinned by a predefined library of security data sources, which specifies how the data is gathered and used to provide ongoing business-related risk information.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Using this framework, changes in risk indicators will alert stakeholders to see which risk component category has triggered the change. Once the category has been identified, stakeholders can drill down into the associated higher-level reporting, trending, information dashboard and data layers to investigate causes of the changed risk-indicator status.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>2) Manage risk by leveraging at-a-glance security incident alerts&lt;br>&#xa;HP Security Metrics Services leverage the HP Executive Scorecard software application to display critical business objectives in a user-friendly dashboard. This allows for quick, at-a-glance security incident alerts that enable users quickly to obtain additional detail, including processes and assets prioritized by their risk status.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP Security Metrics Services use the HP Executive Scorecard coupled with patent pending methodology and framework to help clients:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Deepen executive-level security engagement by demonstrating how specific security risks imperil business objectives.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Reduce risk exposure and minimize security incident damage by alerting key stakeholders to risks, enabling them to take timely and effective action.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Assist regulatory compliance with better incident reporting as well as trends in threats and vulnerabilities that may affect compliance.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>By providing identifiable links among security management activities, supporting resources and business objectives, support investment decisions and track results achieved from security investments.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP's premier Americas client event, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hp.com/go/discover&quot;>HP Discover&lt;/a>, takes place June 10-12 in Las Vegas.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Availability &lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=4AA5-1183ENW&quot;>HP Security Metrics Services&lt;/a> is available immediately worldwide.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>About HP&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society.With the broadest technology portfolio spanning printing, personal systems, software, services and IT infrastructure, HP delivers solutions for customers' most complex challenges in every region of the world.More information about HPis available at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hp.com/&quot;>http://www.hp.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;sup>(1)&lt;/sup> Ponemon, &amp;quot;The state of risk-based security management,&amp;quot; July 2013.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>This news release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
