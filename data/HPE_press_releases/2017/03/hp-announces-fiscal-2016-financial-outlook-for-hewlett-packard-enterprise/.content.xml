As a standalone company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects fiscal 2016 revenue to grow year-over-year in constant currency driven by continued strength in servers, storage and networking, and stabilization in services and software. The company anticipates currency impact to be a three point headwind to revenue growth in fiscal 2016.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Hewlett Packard Enterprise anticipates operating profit dollars to grow year-over-year in fiscal 2016, due to the continued focus on supply chain productivity, disciplined approach to discretionary spending and efforts to reshape the workforce. The new company estimates fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.95, and estimated GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.85.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude after-tax costs of $1.10 primarily related to restructuring charges, separation costs and amortization of intangible assets.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Information about HP's use of non-GAAP financial information is provided under &amp;quot;Use of non-GAAP financial information&amp;quot; below.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Cash Flow&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects to generate approximately $5.0-$5.2 billion in cash flow from operations and $2.0-$2.2 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2016. This includes separation cash payments of $0.4 billion and restructuring cash payments of $1.2 billion.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Excluding these separation and restructuring payments, HP expects Hewlett Packard Enterprise's normalized free cash flow to be approximately $3.7 billion in fiscal 2016.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Capital Allocation Approach&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Stonesifer stressed that Hewlett Packard Enterprise will maintain a disciplined capital allocation framework to drive shareholder value, and expects at least 50% of free cash flow in fiscal 2016 to be returned to shareholders through approximately $400 million in dividends and the remaining in share repurchases.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Restructuring Related Activities&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Stonesifer presented a clear plan to deliver $2.7 billion in ongoing annual cost reductions both associated with the separation and specific to the Enterprise Services (&amp;quot;ES&amp;quot;) business.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>These new activities will enable Hewlett Packard Enterprise to achieve $0.7 billion of ongoing cost savings associated with the separation, including adjustments to real estate strategy and other reorganizations across the portfolio.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>In addition, it will enable ES to achieve $2.0 billion of gross annualized cost reductions, helping ES achieve a long-term, sustainable 7-9% operating profit margin.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>To achieve these savings, Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects 25,000 to 30,000 people to leave the company, primarily associated with the ES transformation.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>This will result in a GAAP-only charge of approximately $2.7 billion, beginning in the fourth quarter fiscal 2015.The cash impact will be approximately $2.6 billion over the next three years, beginning in fiscal 2016.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,&amp;quot; said Whitman.&amp;quot;We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Cloud Strategy Update&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Whitman provided an overview of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's cloud strategy, and how the company is uniquely positioned to help customers migrate more of their applications and services to a hybrid cloud environment.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HPE Helion ensures that customers' applications are deployed to the right IT environment -- based on business requirements like security levels, service availability and regulatory compliance -- making it easier to build, manage and consume workloads in a hybrid IT environment.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Hewlett Packard Enterprise's hybrid infrastructure strategy is consistent with market data that shows that a combination of traditional IT and private clouds will dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Nearly 90% of IT spend over the next three years will be in traditional IT and private cloud.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The company expects cloud revenue in fiscal 2015 to be approximately $3 billion, growing over 20% annually for the next several years.This estimate includes revenue from our enterprise group, software and enterprise services segments which support customers' cloud build and consume.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Business Updates&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Over the course of the day, the future Hewlett Packard Enterprise management team provided updates on business segments, including:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Enterprise Services&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Mike Nefkens, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Enterprise Services (&amp;quot;ES&amp;quot;), gave an overview of the progress ES has made over the past three years and the opportunity ahead. ES, which will be critical to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's solution-based approach, is delivering accelerated profit growth and revenue stabilization in constant currency&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The cost reduction program, including the $2 billion restructuring program, is driving operating profit improvement and will result in a long-term, sustainable, market competitive cost structure with a 7-9% operating margin by fiscal 2018.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Given the importance of Enterprise Services to the overall turnaround strategy, HP provided an outlook for ES for fiscal 2016.Revenue is expected to be flat to down 2% year-over-year in constant currency, however, with continued focus on cost management and operational improvements, operating margin is expected to further improve to be in the range of 6-7% for fiscal 2016.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Approximately 37% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's revenue will come from ES.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Software&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Robert Youngjohns, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Software, discussed the performance of the business and the essential role of Software in the go-forward strategy of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HPE Software is margin accretive with good cash flow, and serves as an intellectual property anchor in the new style of business.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Youngjohns discussed the growth products and areas of investment of Software, and outlined a clear strategy to position Software for long-term growth, including continuing to focus the portfolio around key growth areas.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Approximately 7% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's revenue will come from Software.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Enterprise Group&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Antonio Neri, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Enterprise Group (&amp;quot;EG&amp;quot;), gave an overview of the strategy, performance and key areas of the portfolio that are driving the future of EG.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>EG financial performance has been strong in fiscal 2015, driven by cost reductions, innovative product introductions, a new leadership team and a stronger go-to-market strategy.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Hewlett Packard Enterprise anticipates the overall market for EG to grow at a 3% CAGR, and certain markets such as converged infrastructure, Cloud Hardware and Network Functions Virtualization, to grow at an even faster pace.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Approximately 50% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's revenue will come from EG, spread across servers, storage, networking, and technology services.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Webcast details &lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>A webcast of today's event, along with management presentations and other materials, is available on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=1217531&amp;amp;id=7080955&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fh30261.www3.hp.com%2fnews-and-events%2fhp-investor-events%2fupcoming-events%2f09-15-2015.aspx&quot;>Investor Relations website&lt;/a>. This press release contains only a summary of some of the information being presented at today's event and should be read in conjunction with the management presentations and other materials made available on that website.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>About HP&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society. With the broadest technology portfolio spanning printing, personal systems, software, services and IT infrastructure, HP delivers solutions for customers' most complex challenges in every region of the world. More information about HP is available at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=1217531&amp;amp;id=7080958&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hp.com%2f&quot;>http://www.hp.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Use of non-GAAP financial information&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP has included non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. Definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the slides presented at the 2015 Securities Analyst Meeting, which will be available for a period of one year thereafter at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=1217531&amp;amp;id=7080961&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hp.com%2finvestor%2fSAM2015&quot;>www.hp.com/investor/SAM2015&lt;/a>.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP's management uses revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating income and earnings, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, and HP's non-GAAP tax rate to evaluate and forecast HP's performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by HP's management to be outside of HP's core business segment operating results. HP also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Free cash flow and normalized free cash flow are liquidity measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for investment in HP's businesses, funding strategic acquisitions, repurchasing stock and other purposes.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>These non-GAAP financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of HP's results as reported under GAAP. Items such as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting HP's cash position, represent the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is not included in non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and HP's non-GAAP tax rate and therefore does not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of those intangible assets. In addition, items such as separation and restructuring charges that are excluded from non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and HP's non-GAAP tax rate can have a material impact on cash flows and earnings per share. Free cash flow and normalized free cash flow do not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. The non-GAAP financial information that we provide also may differ from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>We compensate for the limitations on our use of these non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. We also provide robust and detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and we encourage investors to review carefully those reconciliations.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>We believe that providing these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by HP's management in its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see HP's results &amp;quot;through the eyes&amp;quot; of management. We further believe that providing this information better enables investors to understand HP's operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Forward-Looking Statements&lt;br>&#xa;This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
