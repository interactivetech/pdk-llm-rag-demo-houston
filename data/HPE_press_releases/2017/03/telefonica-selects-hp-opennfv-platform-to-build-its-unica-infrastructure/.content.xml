                    textOnly="&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>BARCELONA, SPAIN--(Marketwired - Mar 3, 2015) - At Mobile World Congress Telefnica and HP (NYSE: HPQ) today announced that the telecommunications company has selected HP as the technology provider and systems integrator of the Telefnica Virtualization Infrastructure (project UNICA). Telefnica will implement the end-to-end &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/cloud/nfv-overview.html&quot;>HP OpenNFV&lt;/a> platform stack, including server, software, orchestration and networking technologies, carrier grade HP Helion OpenStack technology, services and expertise.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Telefnica UNICA - Transforming away from a proprietary, siloed network infrastructure&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>The Telefnica UNICA initiative marks a paradigm shift in the way telco networks are designed and installed using existing virtualization technologies. UNICA is focused on extracting maximum benefits from network functions virtualization (NFV), software defined networking (SDN), and cloud technologies. It involves moving from proprietary &amp;quot;vertical&amp;quot; silos to an open, unified &amp;quot;horizontal&amp;quot; architecture, bringing in the future improved centralized management and orchestration (MANO) capabilities and shared hardware resources across services, dramatically reducing operating costs.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;For Telefonica, UNICA is just the first step for a wide and ambitious vision which results in the best experience for our customers. We are starting here with HP, not just a new way to deploy networks, even more, a new way to deploy services all based in cloud,&amp;quot; said Enrique Blanco, Global CTO of Telefnica.&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>NFV will make it quicker and easier for Telefnica to introduce and replicate new services and upgrade the network -- upgrades will be possible in hours, even minutes, instead of months since services are not being tied to physical appliances.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Telefnica plans to follow a three-phase approach to implementing UNICA:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>1.Virtualize non-critical systems, such as AAA and IP Media Subsystem (IMS), deploying them as virtual network functions (VNFs)&lt;br>&#xa;2.Transform to NFV core networks like virtual Evolved Packet Core (vEPC) for LTE&lt;br>&#xa;3.Virtualize critical systems like Home Subscriber Server (HSS) and Home Location Register (HLR)&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>At the same time, Telefonica will use UNICA to deploy new cloud based services and to migrate current virtualized services, in an unprecedented transformation of internal management.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>HP OpenNFV Platform - An end-to-end virtualization stack built around openness&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>The HP approach to NFV is built around adherence to openness and standards. A key benefit of this methodology is the ability to enable other telco ecosystem vendors to introduce new innovations on top of the HP OpenNFV platform, including network equipment providers (NEPs), independent software vendors (ISVs), and systems integrators (SIs). This allows telecommunications providers to choose different components from the vendors that best meet their needs.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;Telefnica was one of the first to realize NFV's potential to transform its network to meet growing customer demands and increasing competitive pressures,&amp;quot; said Saar Gillai, senior vice president, general manager, Network Functions Virtualization, HP. &amp;quot;Telefnica's UNICA initiative and HP's OpenNFV Platform -- both launched just one year ago -- represent real progress in making the transformation to NFV and together will serve as an important point of reference for the telecommunications industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>A key requirement for network transformation through NFV is the shift from expensive, proprietary appliances to open, standards-based hardware. The HP OpenNFV platform is fully compatible with industry standard servers, storage and networking offerings, enabling higher flexibility at a lower cost for deploying and running telecommunications services. The HP OpenNFV platform stack includes:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;u>HP Converged Infrastructure&lt;/u> - Provides workload-optimized systems to run virtualized functions on the carrier network, including compute, storage and networking&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;u>HP Helion CloudSystem&lt;/u> - A complete, integrated, and open solution for building and managing NFV cloud platforms -- helps automate service lifecycle management for any cloud service, from infrastructure to application&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;u>HP NFV Director&lt;/u> - Implements NFV orchestration functionality in the emerging model from European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) critical to NFV operation&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;u>Carrier grade HP Helion OpenStack&lt;/u> - A commercial distribution built on OpenStack technology, providing an open, scalable, and highly available cloud platform that meets CSPs demanding reliability requirements&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;u>HP Distributed Cloud Networking (DCN)&lt;/u> - An SDN virtualization solution that optimizes network resources, increasing agility and speeding time-to-market through dynamic, service-driven configuration&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP Communication and Media Solution experts in conjunction with Technology Services Consulting will help Telefnica prepare the current network infrastructure to adapt to the needs of the next generation services based on NFV and SDN technologies. HP Technology Services Consulting will work with Telefnica to establish the infrastructure designs to meet the performance and availability requirements of VNF, orchestration and carrier grade HP Helion OpenStack. In addition, HP plans to establish an NFV presence in Madrid to support Telefnica's network transformation and define a common strategy.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Telefnica will demonstrate certain services running over an end to end virtualized network, including selected VNFs running on UNICA Execution Environment, at Mobile World Congress 2015, March 2-5, Barcelona, in the Telefnica booth (Hall 3, Stand 3J20). HP and its partners will present several HP OpenNFV demonstrations in the HP booth (Hall 3, Stand 3A20) and the HP Application Partner Showcase (Hall 2, Stand 2D50).&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>About HP&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society.With the broadest technology portfolio spanning printing, personal systems, software, services and IT infrastructure, HP delivers solutions for customers' most complex challenges in every region of the world.More information about HP is available at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hp.com/&quot;>http://www.hp.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>About Telefnica&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Telefnica is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world in terms of market capitalisation and number of customers.
