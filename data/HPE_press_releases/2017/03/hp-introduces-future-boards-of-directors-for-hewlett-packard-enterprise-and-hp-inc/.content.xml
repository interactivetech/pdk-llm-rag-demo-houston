Each board will include members of the current HP board, as well as several new directors chosen after a comprehensive review of personal and professional qualifications as they relate to the specific needs of the two new companies.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Upon completion of the separation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will provide the technology solutions customers need to optimize their traditional IT, while helping them build a secure, cloud-enabled, mobile-ready infrastructure that is uniquely suited to their needs.
