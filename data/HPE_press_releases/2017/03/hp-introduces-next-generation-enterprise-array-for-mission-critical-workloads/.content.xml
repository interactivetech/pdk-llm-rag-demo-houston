To ensure business continuity, enterprises require storage solutions that are designed to maintain high levels of data availability and continuous disaster recovery protection. To drive greater enterprise efficiency, storage systems that serve these mission-critical environments must also drive greater storage consolidation, deliver extremely high performance levels and offer the lowest possible TCO without compromising data availability or data protection.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hp.com/go/xp7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>HP XP7 Storage&lt;/a>offers a combination of six 9s -- or 99.9999 percent -- uptime, which translates to less than 31.5 seconds of application downtime per year,&lt;sup>(1)&lt;/sup> as well as always-on disaster recovery protection, increased system density and ultra-high, flash-driven performance. Capable of delivering 3 million IOPS (I/O per second) with submillisecond response times, HP XP7 Storage is the highest performing, full-featured, enterprise-class disk array, delivering three times the performance of the previous generation of XP Storage.&lt;sup>(2)&lt;/sup>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;Spectrum Health needed a storage solution that would enable us to store mission-critical data securely and allow for constant access to the information with no service disruption,&amp;quot; said Sean Henkel, director, Enterprise Infrastructure, Spectrum Health. &amp;quot;The HP XP7 Storage array safeguards our patient and member information, runs efficiently at a lower power consumption rate, and saves us data center costs while providing greater performance.&amp;quot; &lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Most productive traditional enterprise array&lt;sup>(2) &lt;br>&#xa;&lt;/sup>&lt;/b>The HP XP7's next-generation hardware provides the ability to increase system density, reduce power consumption and achieve low-cost performance, with the latest in host connectivity options and the broadest flash and spinning media choices on the market. These media choices include XP Flash Modules and solid-state drives as well as small and large form factor hard disk drives.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>With consolidation of up to 4.5 PB of internal storage onto a single array, one HP XP7 Storage system is capable of delivering more IOPS than three EMC Symmetrix VMAX 40K storage arrays combined.&lt;sup>(3)&lt;/sup> Consolidating multiple EMC disk arrays onto a single HP XP7 Storage system reduces data center floor space requirements by a total of 130 square feet and storage-relatedcosts by more than $100,000 per year.&lt;sup>(3)&lt;/sup>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Advanced, always-on disaster recovery &lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>With the most critical data residing on enterprise-class storage platforms, organizations must keep data protected and recoverable at all times. HP XP7 Storage features a new disaster recovery capability with multiarray virtualization to prevent business disruption during or after online data migrations, without measurable performance impacts. Data remains protected using the customer's local or remote strategy with 100 percent uptime.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;Today's mission-critical workloads cannot afford to forfeit performance or scalability for increased disaster recovery and data protection,&amp;quot; said David Scott, senior vice president and general manager, HP Storage. &amp;quot;With the introduction of HP XP7 Storage, we are supplying customers with a single system that is highly efficient, with features that can reduce the risk of data loss and provide nonstop data availability.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Reduced data and business risk&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP XP7 Storage features, including new user authentication and access control functions, increase administrative and resource segregation, enabling customers to manage more data more securely. This is particularly important for large enterprise environments where a single system may be used to drive multiple lines of business, serve thousands of internal and external customers, and be managed by several administrators.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>To further address data security requirements, HP XP7 Storage secures data with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 encryption readiness.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Protection for storage investments&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Thorough testing and end-to-end solution certification ensures customers that their HP XP solutions will work as anticipated in their actual environments. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/business-services/it-services.html?compURI=1079286#.U0cWXKhdWf4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>HP Technology Services&lt;/a> has a broad portfolio of services supporting HP XP Storage that provides the consulting expertise and support to boost performance in a converged infrastructure.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>In addition, HP Enterprise Services has integrated the product into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/business-services/it-services.html?compURI=1079586#tab=TAB1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>HP Storage Management Services&lt;/a>, which offers world-class management services providing a selection of storage tiers for all business application needs.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP is the only major storage vendor that offers proven enterprise-class systems for mission-critical enterprise applications with HP XP Storage, as well as purpose-built tier-1 solutions designed for unpredictable workloads such as virtualization and cloud computing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/data-storage/data-storage-products.html?compURI=1225854&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>HP 3PAR StoreServ Storage&lt;/a>.&lt;sup>(2)&lt;/sup> This choice of high-end offerings guarantees that wherever customers are in their transition to a New Style of IT, they have a risk-free path to support their journey.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Pricing and availability&lt;sup>(4) &lt;br>&#xa;&lt;/sup>&lt;/b>HP XP7 Storage will be available in May 2014, starting at $462,000.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>About HP&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society.
