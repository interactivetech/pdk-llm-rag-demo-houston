Now in its second year funding the scholarship, HP's contributions to the SWSIS program reinforce its commitment to supporting women on the front lines of IT security through academic funding and hands-on internship opportunities.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>As the cost, frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks continue to rise, enterprises face the critical challenge of staffing their organizations to adequately combat the growing number of threats and protect their organizations from potential data breaches. At the same time, filling open positions with qualified cybersecurity professionals has emerged as a significant obstacle in the war against hackers. On the heels of research indicating a 40 percent gap in the IT security workforce in 2014&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>, HP committed to education and training initiatives aimed at closing the gap. To ensure diversity in this workforce, HP also committed a $250,000 grant to the SWSIS scholarship program, to be distributed to winners over four years.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;Cybercrime, and its financial and reputational damage, will only increase as our adversaries evolve and continue to outpace the industry,&amp;quot; said Art Gilliland, senior vice president and general manager, Enterprise Security Products, HP. &amp;quot;To stay ahead we must inspire a new generation of talent to enter the IT security field, and HP is committed to providing support for women in particular through programs such as SWSIS to ensure a diverse group of students acquire the skills needed to address this evolving threat landscape.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Together, HP, ACSA and CRA-W have funded scholarships for undergraduates and master's degree candidates from 13 colleges and universities across the United States including:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>California State University, Dominguez Hills&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, Prescott&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Kentucky State University&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Marshall University&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Michigan State University&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Northern Kentucky University&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Pennsylvania State University&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Stony Brook University&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>University of Cincinnati&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>University of Maryland Baltimore County&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>University of Maryland at College Park&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>University of Washington, Tacoma&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;The pool of scholarship candidates this year was impressive -- the new SWSIS fellows demonstrate academic excellence and engagement in their universities and communities, as well as participation in information security events beyond their academic course work,&amp;quot; said Rebecca Wright, professor at Rutgers University and Co-Director of the ACSA/CRA-W SWSIS scholarship program. &amp;quot;It is our goal for these SWSIS fellows to contribute to the representation of women in the information security workforce not only by their own career development, but as ambassadors who encourage others to pursue similar paths.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;There is so much opportunity to pursue a career in the security field, and it's great to see that HP and ASCA are encouraging more women to go down this path,&amp;quot; said Brooke Young, University of Maryland, Baltimore County. &amp;quot;I look forward to starting the new academic year with their support, and continuing to explore new security challenges.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>SWSIS scholarship details&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The SWSIS program was founded by ACSA, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the understanding, theory and practice of cybersecurity.
