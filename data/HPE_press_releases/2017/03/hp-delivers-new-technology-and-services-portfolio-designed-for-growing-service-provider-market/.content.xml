Instead, these organizations will make greater use of dedicated and shared cloud offerings in service provider data centers.&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> To capitalize on these changes, service providers -- software-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service, telco/communication service providers, managed hosters, and consumer service providers -- need an efficient infrastructure that is highly scalable and supports business growth.They also need flexible business models that better align costs to revenue.Additionally, they need to be able to address customers' increasing expectations for service level agreements.&lt;/p> &lt;p>HP's new workload-optimized solutions, flexible business models and partnerships help service providers launch differentiated services faster in the market and stay competitive.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;quot;Service providers must adjust to meet ever-increasing customer demands for simplicity, security and availability -- they can no longer compete on cost alone,&amp;quot; said Antonio Neri, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Enterprise Group, HP. &amp;quot;HP is delivering systems, built on open-design principles, combined with services and solutions that allow service providers to move fast, launch new services and grow their business in a sustainable way.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Create differentiated services&lt;br /> &lt;/strong>HP innovative portfolio includes servers, networking and Service Provider Ready solutions to help service providers create differentiated services. &lt;/p> &lt;p>HP offers a range of servers that can meet the unique compute requirements of service providers. The new &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hp.com/go/cloudline&quot;>HP Cloudline server&lt;/a> family, which is a result of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=1641527&quot;>HP-Foxconn joint venture&lt;/a>, is a portfolio of basic, cost-focused and customizable compute platforms that offer capacity on demand, flexible operations and low costs.Built on open-design principles, HP Cloudline servers support open management tools and leverage common industry interfaces in hardware and firmware. HP Cloudline servers support delivery, deployment and management at an extreme scale and fit easily into multi-vendor environments.&lt;/p> &lt;p>HP Cloudline servers are also optimized for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/cloud/hphelion-openstack.html&quot;>HP Helion OpenStack&lt;/a>. HP Helion OpenStack provides an open, extensible and highly resilient enterprise-grade cloud platform based on OpenStack technology, the leading open source cloud computing platform, which complements the architectural design and benefits of HP Cloudline.&lt;/p> &lt;p>These servers supplement the recently announced HP Altoline of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?wireId=1921691&quot;>open network switches&lt;/a> that are produced by a joint venture between HP and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.accton.com/&quot;>Accton Technology&lt;/a>. The HP Altoline switches are loaded with Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) boot loader giving customers the option of using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://cumulusnetworks.com/&quot;>Cumulus Networks&lt;/a> Linux network OS. The new HP Altoline switches are designed to provide service providers and web scale organizations more flexibility and control in tuning their networking infrastructure to meet the specific applications and business requirements.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hp.com/go/sp&quot;>HP service provider ready solutions&lt;/a> with HP infrastructure, software and services enable service providers to enter new markets and grow revenue.These ready-to-run 'as-a-service' solutions support infrastructure-as-a-service and managed cloud, web services and software-as-a-service, backup and data recovery, security, customer relationship management and business intelligence. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;quot;The industries we serve -- including regulated industries like financial services and life sciences -- require secure collaboration solutions that make it safe and easy to share valuable information anywhere, on any device,&amp;quot; said Ron Hovsepian, Intralinks CEO. &amp;quot;HP's leadership in cloud with HP Helion and service provider ready solutions gives us yet another strategic advantage in delivering world-class, secure content collaboration solutions to enterprises worldwide.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Increase speed and agility&lt;br /> &lt;/strong>To increase speed and agility, HP provides flexible business models for &amp;quot;pay-as-you-grow&amp;quot; financing and tailored support and services.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The new &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-financial-services/index.html&quot;>HP Service Provider Growth Suite&lt;/a> from HP Financial Services provides business flexibility essential for creating and delivering new services that meet the evolving technology needs of customers. The new suite of investment and asset management solutions helps service providers speed migration efforts and create investment capacity within existing environments. Additionally, it helps reduce upfront costs and provides support for ongoing modernization efforts.Another option is to take immediate technology delivery and rapidly scale to customer demands, but only pay when it is deployed and activated. Finally, the suite establishes an asset-lite environment and build unique technology deployment models that help better align costs to recurring revenue streams.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/business-services/it-services.html?compURI=1325121#.VPY1fU05CM9&quot;>HP Datacenter Care for Service Providers&lt;/a> is a flexible, comprehensive, relationship-based approach to personalized support and management of heterogeneous data centers.
