The HP ConvergedSystem 200-HC EVO: RAIL will provide midmarket and enterprises a radically simplified approach to purchasing, deploying, scaling and securing support for their software-defined IT infrastructure.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>As organizations migrate from inefficient legacy systems, the complexities associated with building virtual infrastructure is fueling a 33 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the integrated systems market, which IDC estimates will grow from $5.4 billion in 2013 to $14.3 billion by 2017.&lt;sup>(1)&lt;/sup> Hyper-converged systems are the next phase of the converged infrastructure evolution, aimed to help midsize businesses that require flexible, open architecture to simplify IT operations and transform the speed and efficiency of application service delivery.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;This collaboration between HP and VMware to deliver EVO: RAIL&lt;/i> &lt;i>will provide organizations with an innovative approach to driving better business outcomes through a software-defined data center architecture,&amp;quot; said Raghu Raghuram, executive vice president, Software-Defined Data Center Division, VMware. &amp;quot;Together, HP and VMware are helping customers dramatically simplify and accelerate the delivery of software-defined infrastructure services while lowering operating expenses.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Hyper-convergence introduces a new IT infrastructure delivery and consumption model with a software-centric architecture that tightly integrates compute, network, storage and management resources seamlessly. HP ConvergedSystem 200-HC EVO: RAIL promises to provide businesses a cost-effective solution to improve service deployment and new workload efficiencies. Customers will be able to quickly deploy a single appliance, enabling faster response times to business demands, simplified infrastructure administration and reduced operating costs.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;Today businesses are looking for more efficient ways to speed time to application and service delivery that reduce the strain on existing infrastructure, said Nariman Teymourian, senior vice president and general manager, Converged Systems, HP. &amp;quot;Our collaboration with VMware to deliver hyper-converged infrastructure reinforces our commitment to provide customers superior technology choices as they migrate from inefficient legacy systems to modern integrated infrastructure.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The HP ConvergedSystem 200-HC EVO: RAIL features a pre-integrated, pre-tested 100 percent VMware software stack, to provide high availability at both the compute and storage layers, with VMware vSphere, VMware Virtual SAN, VMware vRealize Log Insight (formerly vCenter Log Insight), and the EVO: RAIL engine. VMware EVO: RAIL integrates these technologies to greatly simplify by consolidating IT resources into a single appliance, eliminating the need for complex integration and enabling new applications to come online quickly.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The EVO: RAIL engine radically simplifies appliance scale-out, management and operations. Customers benefit from time to value to first virtual machine in minutes, as well as non-disruptive patching and upgrades of the appliance. Software-defined infrastructure services can be deployed rapidly and in a repeatable reliable fashion starting with one appliance of four nodes and growing to four appliances of 16 nodes.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>In addition, HP and VMware are jointly collaborating to extend HP OneView, an innovative management platform for convergence, to EVO: RAIL to offer customers greater efficiencies and an integrated experience. Architected for simplicity and convergence, in future releases HP OneView will be able to directly manage the EVO: RAIL appliance to help unify the management of the hyper-converged and traditional infrastructure deployments.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP's new ConvergedSystem 200 line of hyper-converged solutions will feature two new solutions -- an HP EVO: RAIL version and an HP StoreVirtual version, offering customers greater choice and flexibility.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Pricing and Availability&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP ConvergedSystem 200-HC EVO: RAIL is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2015.
