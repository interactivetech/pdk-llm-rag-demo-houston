The agreement with HP is intended to increase staff productivity and efficiency and enhance service delivery to the state's welfare clients.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>CalWIN, one of the largest human services systems in the United States, supports the work of nearly 12,000 employees who are responsible for providing public assistance services to more than 2.6 million California families. The system manages 40 percent of California's entire welfare caseload and processes an average of 22 million transactions per day for public assistance programs, including food and nutrition assistance and medical services.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The system supports California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids, CalFresh, Medi-Cal, County Medical Services Program, Cash Assistance Program for Immigrants, Kinship Guardian Assistance Payment Program, foster care and adoptions, general assistance programs and employment services required by the programs.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The agreement further strengthens the HP-CalWIN relationship, which began with the development of CalWIN to efficiently administer public assistance programs and provide quality services to its communities. As part of the contract, HP will implement modernization projects to improve the system's business intelligence, document management and customer service functions.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;It is important that California health and welfare workers have access to collaborative, flexible solutions that enable the quick and accurate delivery of benefits to qualified families,&amp;quot; said Hali Reyes, executive director, WCDS.&amp;quot;With HP as our technology vendor, we are confident that CalWIN will continue to provide county managers the necessary tools to improve service delivery, increase productivity and efficiency, enhance accuracy and reduce the overall cost of program administration.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>CalWIN provides multiple access channels for clients to interact with county social service staff and the CalWIN systems.Interactive voice recognition, internet portal and mobile application technologies are all used to support comprehensive services to the clients. Additional technologies will be implemented to support enhanced service and outcomes through advanced analytics.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;The ability to provide California's WCDS consortium a reliable infrastructure solution is vital to streamlining operations so people in need receive the appropriate benefits in a timely manner,&amp;quot; said Susan Arthur, vice president, U.S. Health and Life Sciences Industry, HP Enterprise Services. &amp;quot;The implementation of CalWIN demonstrates that technology can play an important role in meeting complex business objectives to support customer service delivery to Californians.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Over the past 10 years, CalWIN has won more than a dozen awards from respected organizations including the National Association of Counties, the American Public Human Services Association, CIO Magazine, Government Technology, Computerworld and the Center for Digital Government.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>About HP&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society.
