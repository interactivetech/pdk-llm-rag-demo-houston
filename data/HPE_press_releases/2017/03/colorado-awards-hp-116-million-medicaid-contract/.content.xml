HP also will serve as the state's system integrator to facilitate interface development between the Colorado MMIS and the state's pharmacy benefits management, business intelligence and data management systems.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The Colorado MMIS will be based on HP's interChange Healthcare platform, a powerful, constantly evolving solution that gives states and their providers access to leading-edge technology aimed at cutting costs, increasing access to information, reducing implementation risk and improving provider satisfaction. Colorado, choosing HP's most current version of interChange, will be the 15&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> state to implement the interChange platform, which has been implemented and federally certified in 13 states over the past decade. A 14&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> interChange solution is being implemented in another state.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing is responsible for overseeing Medicaid and Child Health Plan &lt;i>PLUS &lt;/i>benefits, and processes about 44 million claims for approximately 39,000 providers who serve more than 950,000 clients&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;Colorado interChange will support our Accountable Care Collaborative program, a growing number of clients and social service organizations, and the shift to outcome-focused care while also helping us prepare for federal reform,&amp;quot; said Chris Underwood, deputy director, Finance Office, Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing. &amp;quot;HP has proven its deep MMIS knowledge and experience in other states, and we expect the new Colorado interChange system will help us deliver the best possible care in the most cost-effective way.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The Colorado interChange MMIS will give the state the ability to adjust quickly to state and federal policy changes while processing daily medical and dental claims for the state's Medicaid clients. Healthcare providers will be able to receive real-time claims adjudication and resolution via a secure provider website, and Medicaid clients will be able to access their information to make healthcare decisions via a secure client website. The state will use HP provider services including call center and technical helpdesk services.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>In support of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://co.arraincentive.com/&quot;>Colorado Registration and Attestation System&lt;/a>, HP also will implement its award-winning Medical Assistance Provider Incentive Repository (MAPIR) tool to help track incentive payments for meaningful use of electronic health record technologies.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;In this era of healthcare reform, Medicaid agencies must tackle quickly evolving regulatory requirements, stretch budget dollars even further and address the shift to consumer empowerment -- all while driving higher quality outcomes,&amp;quot; said Susan Arthur, vice president, U.S. Health and Life Sciences Industry, HP Enterprise Services. &amp;quot;The HP interChange Healthcare Platform is designed to enable a smooth transition to a CMS-certified system that will allow Colorado to maintain fiscal responsibility while continuing to provide for those in need.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP is the nation's largest provider of Medicaid and Medicare process management services, administering $140 billion in benefits a year. It serves as the fiscal agent or principal IT provider for Medicaid in 19 states. HP's U.S. healthcare experience spans payer, government and life science communities.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>About HP&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society.
