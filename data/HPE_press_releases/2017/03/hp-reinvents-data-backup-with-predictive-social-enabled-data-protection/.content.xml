Burgess, manager, Information Technology Services, BlueShore Financial. &amp;quot;This enables us to take the guesswork out of the planning process and significantly reduce operational cost.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Today's data centers are under siege. With unprecedented data volumes, diverse data formats, mobile workforces, and increasing adoption of cloud and virtualization, yesterday's backup and recovery models have been rendered obsolete. It is simply becoming too costly, ineffective and risky to rely on static legacy systems to protect an organization's vital enterprise information.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP Autonomy, the industry leader in data protection with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.autonomy.com/work/news/details/ho65btle&quot;>more than 60,000 customers&lt;/a>, is pursuing a new and divergent path to bring the backup industry into the modern era. Based on the premise that backup should be adaptive, dynamic and self-aware, HP Autonomy Adaptive Backup and Recovery solutions empower organizations to overcome complexity with simple, intuitive, collaborative and real-time data protection.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>HP Backup Navigator -- connect, collaborate and share analytical insights&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP Backup Navigator is the first data protection tool based on in-depth operational analytics that allow for effective navigation of an organization's backup landscape. Key features include:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Dynamic, interactive &amp;quot;drill down&amp;quot; graphical dashboard powered by real-time operational analytics deliver actionable insight to historical, current and future performance.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Collaborative, enhanced social media capabilities and automated report creation and sharing allows different teams of data center administrators within an organization to automatically share their backup policies and analytics dashboards. Other team members can then respond by marking as a favorite or sharing other related dashboards and reports.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Real-time, predictive analytics enable businesses to anticipate issues.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Extensive backward compatibility for previous versions of HP Data Protector means this tool can be immediately leveraged across the HP Data Protector global customer base.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>HP Data Protector 9.0 -- a new class of data protection for the enterprise &lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP Data Protector 9.0 offers enhancements that build upon HP's flagship adaptive, self-aware backup and recovery solution to:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Support the integration with HP Storage and the next-generation federated deduplication capabilities of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/data-storage/data-storage-products.html?compURI=1225909&quot;>HP StoreOnce Backup Systems&lt;/a>.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Offer rapid recovery of VMware vSphere virtual disks through the new SmartCache feature, saving time and resources and improving administration agility.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Secure backup workloads in dynamic environments through encryption, protecting deduped data in flight and at rest.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Support EMC's family of storage offerings with native support for EMC Data Domain Boost.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>HP Data Protector Management Pack -- active alerting and event management &lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP Data Protector Management Pack with plug-in support for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager enables organizations to centrally monitor and report on the health, performance and availability of the entire HP Data Protector environment.
