                    textOnly="&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Oct 28, 2014) - HP Enterprise Services today announced that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) has signed a $116.5 million agreement for HP (NYSE: HPQ) to continue managing the state's Strategic Offender Management System (SOMS), one of the largest electronic corrections system in the United States.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Under the five-year contract, HP will continue to provide a full suite of IT services for SOMS, a statewide inmate management system designed to maximize access to offender information to improve day-to-day business processes and increase citizen safety. In addition to the management and hosting of SOMS, HP will also provide CDCR with disaster recovery and backup support of IT-enabled business processes to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>SOMS streamlines business processes by consolidating legacy databases and converting inmate records to digital files. With the HP implementation, CDCR is able to coordinate offender information, case management plans, and other inmate data in a single system for the first time and standardize state prison population management practices across California.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;i>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;For the number of inmates we house and process, a paper-based system was a logistical nightmare,&amp;quot; said Russ Nichols, SOMS Project Director, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. &amp;quot;Since partnering with HP nearly five years ago to implement SOMS, we have seen significant improvements in efficiency, including greater employee access to accurate and complete offender information as well as reductions in operational costs.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>During the SOMS implementation, HP streamlined dozens of CDCR databases and record-keeping processes by implementing a new online system for offender management and digitizing over 200 million documents. SOMS now houses a complete and up-to-date corrections file for CDCR and provides inmate tracking to more effectively manage the prison system.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;i>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;Uninterrupted, real time access to offender information is critical for corrections agencies to enable policy outcomes, improve operational effectiveness and create administrative efficiencies,&amp;quot; said Brian Kitzmiller, vice president, State and Local Government, HP Enterprise Services. &amp;quot;The implementation of SOMS demonstrates that technology can play an important role in the effective and efficient administration of justice while making prisons and jails safer for both corrections officers and inmates.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>More information about HP's services and solutions for justice-related branches of government is available at&amp;nbsp;http://hp.com/enterprise/gov/justice.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>&lt;br>&#xa;About HP&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society.
