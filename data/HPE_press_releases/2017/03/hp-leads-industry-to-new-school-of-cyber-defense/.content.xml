As information flows through data centers to the cloud and out to personal devices, the data must be secured at every step. The new HP Security products and services announced today address this approach to security incorporating user behavior analytics, data-centric cloud access protection, mobile application reputation analysis, contextual threat intelligence sharing, and incident response.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Organizations worldwide spent approximately $77 billion on cyber security in 2014,&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> while successful breaches increased 25 percent.&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> Adversaries continue to evolve while organizations increasingly adopt new ways of doing business -- and the current approach to securing interactions between users, applications and data isn't keeping up.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>This calls for a new approach to cyber defense. Building on security fundamentals such as monitoring events and securing the perimeter, organizations must shift their focus to protecting what matters most -- the interaction between the users, the applications and the data that carry the sensitive information adversaries target.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;The old school approach to cyber security focused on securing the perimeter, but the data powering business today goes beyond our four walls and must be protected from cyber threats regardless of where it resides,&amp;quot; said Art Gilliland (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ArtGilliland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>@ArtGilliland&lt;/a>), senior vice president and general manager, HP Security. &amp;quot;In today's environment, we must challenge ourselves to embrace the new school of thinking that goes beyond the infrastructure to protect what matters most -- the interactions between users, applications and data that when protected, can fuel our businesses and accelerate growth.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Tackling Insider Threats through Behavioral Analytics&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP today announced a new offering that gives companies visibility into user behavior, delivering a simple, efficient way to detect malicious users within the enterprise. Partnering with security analytics company &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.securonix.com/&quot;>Securonix&lt;/a> to deliver an interoperable security intelligence offering designed to help track and identify the &amp;quot;enemy within,&amp;quot; HP ArcSight User Behavior Analytics (UBA) leverages the behavioral data generated by enterprise users along with broader network event intelligence to detect even the most complex threats.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Extending Cloud Data-Centric Security &lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP today announced a new cloud access security platform designed to complement the existing HP Atalla cloud security portfolio, and expand its leadership in data-centric security. The new HP Cloud Access Security Protection platform provides 'borderless' protection of the data itself -- at rest, in use or in motion -- through a partnership with cloud access security broker Adallom to bring enhanced cloud security monitoring, governance and control capabilities to HP customers. The platform integrates HP's existing suite of data security offerings including HP Atalla Information Protection and Control (IPC), an added-value security solution that automatically encrypts files when moving information in and out of the cloud or across platforms.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Empowering BYOD through Mobile Application Protection&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP today announced a new offering to help its customers manage their Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policies more intelligently by providing a fully-integrated mobile application reputation database within the HP Fortify on Demand cloud-based portal. To further protect the interactions between users, data and the applications, all HP Fortify on Demand customers can now request free reputation and behavioral analysis of company-owned applications or those found in major app stores worldwide.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Going Beyond Threat Intelligence Sharing&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Perhaps one of the best weapons in a company's security defense arsenal is collaboration. Because information sharing is intrinsic to a comprehensive security strategy, HP Security has developed HP Threat Central, which is now generally available for all customers. Delivering automated and open sharing of information, HP Threat Central offers contextual analysis of information, prioritization of security data and identification of results that will allow organizations to take action.In addition to value-added intelligence, analysis of underground forums and threat actor profiling from HP Security Research, HP Security is also working to augment the HP Threat Central service with intelligence feeds from a network of companies, including &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.alienvault.com/?utm_medium=PR&quot;>AlienVault&lt;/a> and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.crowdstrike.com/&quot;>Crowdstrike&lt;/a>.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Addressing Incident Response and Advanced Threat Detection &lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP Security is focused on building a comprehensive set of best-in-class security offerings to deliver unparalleled global access to a comprehensive suite of security remediation services. In line with this mission, HP Security and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fireeye.com/&quot;>FireEye&lt;/a> today announced a partnership that will deliver incident response offerings and develop an industry standard reference architecture providing customers with a blueprint for advanced threat protection services and incident response capabilities.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>This partnership offers customers choice, and supports HP's overall strategy to deliver world class security capabilities.
