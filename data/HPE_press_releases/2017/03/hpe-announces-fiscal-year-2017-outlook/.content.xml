All of this is delivered through a world-class services capability.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Following a number of strategic portfolio moves, including the spin-offs and mergers of the Enterprise Services and Software businesses, the future HPE will have the right assets to achieve this vision, including core software and services capabilities that differentiate HPE from its competitors and deliver the company's infrastructure solutions.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Market Opportunity for the Future HPE&lt;br>&#xa;

&lt;/b>Tim Stonesifer, Executive Vice President and CFO of HPE, provided a financial update, including an outlook for FY17.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Reaffirms FY16 Financial Outlook&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HPE reaffirmed its FY16 outlook.Revenue is expected to grow 1-2% year-over-year when adjusted for recent divestitures and currency.FY16 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $1.90 to $1.95, which is at the high end of the original outlook for the year.As communicated on HPE's third quarter earnings call, the company expects to deliver free cash flow of $1.7 to $1.9 billion in FY16, and to return over $3 billion of cash to shareholders this year, in the form of share repurchases and dividends.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Three Views of FY17 Financial Outlook&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Given two pending transactions -- the spin-merge of Enterprise Services with CSC in early April and the spin-merge of Software with Micro Focus in the second half of FY17 -- Stonesifer provided three different views of HPE's FY17 financial outlook:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>An outlook for the company as it stands today, with a full year contribution from ES and Software, which is comparable to current estimates for FY17;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>An outlook as the financial results will actually be reported, with partial year contributions from both ES and Software;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>An outlook for the future HPE, excluding the partial year contributions from both ES and Software in FY17, which gives a more comparable view for FY18.&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Combined Company Outlook&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>First, as HPE is structured today, including a full year of ES and Software contribution, HPE expects revenue to be flat to down 1% when adjusted for divestitures and currency.HPE expects non-GAAP EPS to be $2.00 to $2.10 and GAAP EPS to be $0.72 to $0.82.On a normalized basis, excluding the impact from restructuring and separation costs, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>As Reported Outlook&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>When adjusted for the lower EPS contribution and expenses associated with the ES and Software transactions, HPE expects reported non-GAAP EPS to be approximately $1.45 to $1.55 and GAAP EPS to be $0.29 - $0.39.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>FY17 reported free cash flow will also be reduced from the normalized level due to the partial year contribution from ES and Software, previously announced restructuring and separation payments, and a $2.5 billion payment to fund the ES pension associated with the spin-merge.Given these factors, HPE expects to deliver negative free cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion in FY17.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>While HPE's FY17 free cash flow will be negative due to the pension funding payment, the operating company's net cash level on its balance sheet is expected to increase from approximately $7 billion at the end of FY16 to approximately $11 billion in FY17, primarily due to the ES and Software transactions and the underlying strength of HPE's normalized free cash flow engine.With this in mind, the company is committed to returning approximately $3 billion in total to shareholders in FY17, and will end the year with an operating company net cash balance of approximately $8 billion.In addition, the company expects cash flow to approach normalized levels in FY18.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;In FY17, we will maintain our disciplined capital allocation framework, with a bias towards share repurchases,&amp;quot; said Stonesifer in his remarks.&amp;quot;Given our strong cash position today, the cash we will receive from the ES and Software transactions, and the underlying strength of our normalized free cash flow engine, we are committed to returning approximately $3 billion in total to shareholders in FY17.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Future HPE Outlook&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Stonesifer also discussed how HPE's financial profile will be improved following the completion of the ES and Software transactions, and provided an outlook for the future HPE, excluding ES and Software for the full year.The future HPE is expected to see modest revenue growth in FY17.Non-GAAP EPS would be approximately $1.25 to $1.35 in FY17 with GAAP EPS of $0.29 to $0.39.On a normalized basis, the company expects free cash flow to be approximately $2.1 to $2.4 billion.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;HPE's financial profile will be improved following the ES and Software transactions,&amp;quot; Stonesifer continued.&amp;quot;HPE will be a faster growing, higher margin company, with strong cash flow in FY18 and beyond.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Business Updates&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Enterprise Group&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>In his presentation, Antonio Neri, EVP and GM of the Enterprise Group, recapped EG's solid performance to date in FY16, outlined a clear strategy aligned to market opportunities and customer needs, and described the steps the business is taking to optimize its operating model and deliver strong profitability.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Enterprise Services&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>In his presentation, Mike Nefkens, EVP and GM of Enterprise Services, provided highlights of the three-year turnaround of the business, specifically its stabilized revenue, higher win rates and doubled margins since FY13. He also discussed the upcoming &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=1281814&amp;amp;id=9953620&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.hpe.com%2fus%2fen%2fnewsroom%2fnews-archive%2fpress-release%2f2016%2f05%2f2062989-hewlett-packard-enterprise-announces-plans-for-tax-free-spin-off-and-merger-of-enterprise-services-business-with-csc.html&quot;>spin-off and merger with CSC&lt;/a>, which creates significant value for HPE shareholders and allows ES to accelerate its journey.

With the industry's most comprehensive portfolio, spanning the cloud to the data center to workplace applications, our technology and services help customers around the world make IT more efficient, more productive and more secure.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Use of non-GAAP financial information&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise's financial information presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides forecasts of revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency, as well as non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP measure of earnings/loss from equity interests, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, free cash flow and normalized free cash flow financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the slides presented at the 2016 Securities Analyst Meeting, which will be available for a period of one year thereafter at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=1281814&amp;amp;id=9953629&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fhpe.com%2finvestor%2fsam2016&quot;>http://hpe.com/investor/sam2016&lt;/a>.In addition, an explanation of the ways in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its business, the substance behind Hewlett Packard Enterprise's decision to use these non-GAAP measures, the material limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures, the manner in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons why Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors is included under &amp;quot;Use of non-GAAP financial measures&amp;quot; further below. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, operating margin, diluted net earnings per share, cash flow from operations in accordance with GAAP.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise's historical and prospective financial performance, as well as Hewlett Packard Enterprise's performance relative to its competitors. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its own understanding of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's segment operating performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to better understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise's consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's segments, as Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Material limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's results as reported under GAAP&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Compensation for limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Hewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures accompanying this news release, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review carefully those reconciliations.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing forecasts of revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP measure of earnings/loss from equity interests, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, free cash flow and normalized free cash flow financial measures to investors in addition to certain related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see Hewlett Packard Enterprise's results &amp;quot;through the eyes&amp;quot; of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further believes that providing this information better enables Hewlett Packard Enterprise's investors to understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise's operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's operating performance with the performance of other companies in Hewlett Packard Enterprise's industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Forward Looking Statements&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
