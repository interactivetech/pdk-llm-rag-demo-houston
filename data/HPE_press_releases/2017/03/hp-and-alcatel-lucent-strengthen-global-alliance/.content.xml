And it will allow us to leverage the strengths of both companies to increase the value we deliver to those customers,&amp;quot; said Basil Alwan, President Alcatel-Lucent IP Routing and Transport. &amp;quot;Together, we will continue to innovate and offer large enterprises and service providers the industry's most agile and flexible solutions with the right performance and economics for the cloud era.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>&lt;br>&#xa;Increased business agility with new wide-ranging storage solutions&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;/b>HP Storage will extend its solutions between datacenters to provide joint HP and Alcatel-Lucent customers with fully validated end-to-end business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities.
