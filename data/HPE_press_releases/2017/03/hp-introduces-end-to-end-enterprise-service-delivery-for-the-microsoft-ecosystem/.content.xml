With complete HP service accountability, this Microsoft ecosystem helps transform enterprises to allow users to work seamlessly across mobile devices and PCs while helping IT manage the user environment and data security at the user level rather than at the device level.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Building on the recent &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=1849126#.VQIIseHhN1E&quot;>agreement&lt;/a> with Microsoft to offer Office 365 and HP service delivery as one comprehensive enterprise solution, HP is now adding EMS to its Microsoft ecosystem offering to improve productivity and help reduce risk, complexity and costs while accelerating the convergence of mobile and desktop management. Adding service delivery for EMS to HP's Microsoft ecosystem offerings delivers a common management platform across multiple operating systems and devices, and using a common identity delivers capabilities such as single sign-on to apps, self-service password reset and rights management.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;When deploying mobility and workplace solutions in the enterprise, our customers want a simplified, consumer-grade experience that empowers employees to be more productive anytime, anywhere on any device they choose,&amp;quot; &lt;/i>said Mike Nefkens, executive vice president, HP Enterprise Services. &lt;i>&amp;quot;Implementing EMS into an existing Office 365 environment allows customers to realize the full potential of both solutions while providing a lower cost on-ramp for Windows 10 upgrades in the future&lt;/i>.&lt;i>&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Microsoft Enterprise Mobility Suite&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Microsoft EMS enables enterprises to keep their users productive on their favorite apps and devices, while helping keep corporate data safe.EMS brings together leading identity and access management capabilities, including multi-factor-authentication, together with PC and mobile device management, which delivers unique managed productivity capabilities for the Office mobile apps, in addition to file level data protection.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Implementing EMS into an existing Windows environment allows for strong integration with Office 365 and Windows 8.1, and capabilities increase with Windows 10 when available.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;HP's position as a Preferred Partner, combined with our 30 year relationship, provides a strong foundation to help enterprise IT embrace our mobile-first, cloud-first world,&amp;quot; said Scott Guthrie, Executive VP of the Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Group. &amp;quot;By adding EMS to HP's offering we'll provide a simple and natural extension of the benefits already experienced by over 6 million devices currently managed by System Center Configuration Manager and HP Managed Desktop.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP advisory and transformation services for Workplace of the Future, Microsoft Azure AD, and Microsoft Office 365 are available today.HP Services for Office 365 and Skype for Business (including HP management of an Office 365 environment) are also available today.Additional advisory, transformation, and management services will be made available in 2015.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Additional information about this offering and other HP mobility solutions are available at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hp.com/go/hpes4msecosystem&quot;>www.hp.com/go/hpes4msecosystem&lt;/a>.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>About HP&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society.With the broadest technology portfolio spanning printing, personal systems, software, services and IT infrastructure, HP delivers solutions for customers' most complex challenges in every region of the world.More information about HP is available at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hp.com/&quot;>http://www.hp.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
