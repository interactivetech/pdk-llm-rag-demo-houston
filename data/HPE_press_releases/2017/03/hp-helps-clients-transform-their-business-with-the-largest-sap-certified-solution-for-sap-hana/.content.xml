Business-critical applications -- such as those for enterprise resource planning, supply chain and customer relationship management -- are vital to business operations and require a highly scalable infrastructure that can ensure up to 100-percent uptime.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The new HP ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA is certified by SAP to deliver up to 12 terabytes of data in a single memory pool to power the most mission-critical business applications. The commercialization resulting from the HP and SAP co-innovation initiative &amp;quot;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=1411830#.U1_d5lVdXTp&quot;>Project Kraken&lt;/a>,&amp;quot; HP ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA is a massively scalable system that enables clients to manage and analyze extremely large and diverse data sets from a single system to facilitate real-time business decisions. In addition, the system's flexible configurations and high availability let clients consolidate mission-critical business apps to a centralized platform, helping reduce costs and simplifying the IT environment.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;Businesses are adopting SAP HANA to make real-time business decisions based on massive data sets, but are often constrained by their infrastructure's scalability and availability,&amp;quot; said Tom Joyce, senior vice president and general manager, Converged Systems, HP. &amp;quot;With HP ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA, HP is helping customers achieve business transformation with SAP HANA by delivering a system optimized for the largest, most mission-critical workloads.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Enabling increased operational efficiency while reducing downtime&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA is designed to deliver a rapid return on investment. It is preconfigured, optimized and tested by HP Factory Express, enabling clients to order, install and operate the system in as little as 30 days.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>In addition, the new system allows clients to:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Increase operational efficiency by consolidating mission-critical applications on the same platform.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Rapidly respond to business needs by quickly scaling system capacity with 6TB/8-socket and 12TB/16-socket scale-up configurations using Intel Xeon processor E7v2 family.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Reduce downtime with HP Serviceguard for SAP HANA, which provides high-availability and disaster-tolerant features for enterprise data protection.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Further ensure business continuity with up to 12 TB of in-memory computing. This allows clients to smoothly and securely transition their landscape running SAP HANA from legacy databases.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>Increase IT staff efficiency with intelligent manageability features that provide IT a single point of management for the server, blades, fault-tolerant fabric and enclosure.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;In-memory computing allows organizations to quickly make informed business decisions by processing massive amounts of data much faster than ever possible before,&amp;quot; said Matt Eastwood, group vice president and general manager, Enterprise Platforms, IDC. &amp;quot;However, to capitalize on its benefits, organizations need a highly scalable data management environment that allows organizations to capture and analyze all of their information on one platform, eliminating the need to transfer data from other systems -- a major source of information delay.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Dedicated support for HP ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA&lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP also introduced HP Proactive Care Advanced as the recommended level of support for HP ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA. It provides clients with a single point of accountability for support of all system components. Dedicated technical resources proactively help prevent issues, maximize performance and accelerate problem resolution with personalized reports, best practices and on-going technical advice. This enables clients to optimize the usage and functionality of their IT system throughout its lifetime, while accelerating problem resolution with dedicated critical-case management.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>In addition, HP announced new &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hp.com/services/saphana&quot;>HP Consulting Services for SAP HANA&lt;/a> that deliver rapid deployment and a smooth migration to HP ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA. The new services help clients migrate confidently to the environment, in addition to automating and simplifying system replication with the HP Serviceguard solution for SAP HANA, and validating the system operational readiness to meet unique business needs.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Cloud-based services offer flexible, cost-effective deployment model for SAP HANA &lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>HP is bringing new cloud-based services to SAP HANA through HP Helion Business Applications for SAP solutions. A flexible, cost-effective deployment model, this solution extends the power of the cloud across infrastructure, applications and information. Also built on HP Converged Infrastructure, the managed cloud combines server, storage and network resources to provide customers with a secure hosted environment to run critical business applications with high availability from multiple locations -- reducing latency and meeting data-sovereignty requirements.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>In addition to the HP Helion cloud deployment model, HP has the capability to deploy Rapid Deployment Services for SAP solutions in the cloud. This helps make it possible to deploy new application functionality optimized for SAP HANA in highly reduced timeframes, increasing the velocity of the deployment of new innovation to drive a client's desired business outcomes.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The HP Helion Business Applications deployment model may also be enabled via the HP as-a-Service Offering for SAP HANA. This solution lets clients take advantage of the SAP HANA platform while financing through an OpEx consumption model for predictable monthly payment options that align operational and financial requirements to the business.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&amp;quot;Our partnership with HP has always been about co-innovating and collaborating to provide new technology solutions that help our customers transform their business,&amp;quot; said Kevin Ichhpurani, senior vice president, Corporate Business Development and Strategic Ecosystem, SAP. &amp;quot;The new HP ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA further extends the power of SAP HANA into enterprise organizations, supporting massive data sets and mission-critical workloads, speeding up response times and reducing costs, all in a single platform, near real-time environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>HP received two 2014 SAP Pinnacle awards for Co-Innovation Partner of the Year and Rapid-Deployment Partner of the Year.
