Additionally, the hosting-as-a-service model will continue to transition away from traditional models toward cloud-based delivery mechanisms like infrastructure as a service, spurring hyperscale growth in servers used for hosting (15 to 20 percent CAGR from 2013 to 2018).&lt;sup>(1)&lt;/sup>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The changing needs of cloud computing require a new approach to server design that brings together cloud solutions expertise, quick customer response and volume manufacturing. Creating innovative servers and solutions has been a cornerstone of the relationship between Foxconn and HP for several decades and today's announcement further strengthens the partnership. Foxconn's ability to deliver superior value throughout the supply chain, together with HP's industry compute leadership and industry-recognized service and support, will deliver new world-class computing platforms by bringing high-density, easy-to-manage, cost-competitive solutions to market.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>The new product line will specifically address compute requirements of the world's largest service providers by delivering low total cost of ownership (TCO), scale, and service and support. The line will complement HP's existing ProLiant server portfolio, including Moonshot.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;With the relentless demands for compute capabilities, customers and partners are rapidly moving to a New Style of IT that requires focused, scalable and high-volume system designs,&amp;quot; said &lt;/i>&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-information/executive-team/team.html#meg-whitman&quot;>&lt;i>Meg Whitman&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;i>, president and chief executive officer, HP. &amp;quot;This partnership reflects business model innovation in our server business, where the high-volume design and manufacturing expertise of Foxconn, combined with the compute and service leadership of HP, will enable us to deliver a game-changing offering in infrastructure economics.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;i>&amp;quot;Cloud computing is radically changing the entire supply chain for the server market as customers place new demands on the breadth of design capability, value-oriented solutions and large-scale and global manufacturing capabilities,&amp;quot; said Terry Gou, founder and chairman, Foxconn. &amp;quot;In partnership with HP's server leadership, we are embracing this new opportunity to change the industry, capture growth in this emerging market, and deliver end-to-end value as we expand our global leadership in design and manufacturing.&amp;quot;&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;span class=&quot;body-copy-large&quot;>&lt;b>Pricing and availability &lt;br>&#xa; &lt;/b>The non-equity joint venture, in the form of a strategic commercial agreement, will take effect on May 1.
